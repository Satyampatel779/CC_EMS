# Employee Leaves Page - Loading Issue Fixed

## Problem
The employee leaves page was stuck in an infinite loading state and not displaying any data.

## Root Causes
1. **Wrong API Endpoint**: The page was using `/api/v1/leave/all` which is restricted to HR only
2. **Missing Employee-Specific Route**: No dedicated endpoint existed for employees to access their own leave requests  
3. **User Dependency**: Page was dependent on Redux user object that might not be available
4. **Field Name Mismatch**: Frontend was using different field names than the backend model

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New Controller Function (`Leave.controller.js`)
- Added `HandleEmployeeLeaves` function
- Retrieves leave requests for the authenticated employee only
- Uses employee ID from JWT token (`req.EMid`)
- Filters by organization and sorts by creation date

#### New Route (`Leave.route.js`)
- Added new route: `GET /api/v1/leave/employee/my-leaves`
- Protected with `VerifyEmployeeToken` middleware
- Accessible only to authenticated employees

### 2. Frontend Changes (`EmployeeLeaves.jsx`)

#### API Integration
- Updated to use new endpoint: `/api/v1/leave/employee/my-leaves`
- Fixed authentication token to use `EMtoken` instead of `token`
- Removed dependency on Redux user object

#### Form Submission
- Updated form data mapping to match backend model:
  - `title` from `leaveType`
  - `startdate` from `startDate`
  - `enddate` from `endDate`
  - `type` from `leaveType`
  - `reason` remains the same

#### Table Display
- Updated field names to match backend model:
  - `leave.type` instead of `leave.leaveType`
  - `leave.startdate` instead of `leave.startDate`
  - `leave.enddate` instead of `leave.endDate`

## Testing Results
- ✅ Backend server restarted and running on port 5001
- ✅ New employee leaves endpoint responding with 401 (authentication required)
- ✅ Frontend client running with hot module replacement
- ✅ No compilation errors in updated component
- ✅ All field mappings aligned with backend model

## Expected Behavior
When an authenticated employee accesses the leaves page:
1. Page should load immediately without infinite loading
2. Display existing leave requests in a table
3. Allow submission of new leave requests
4. Show proper status badges (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
5. Calculate leave days correctly
6. Handle form validation properly

## API Endpoint Status
- `GET /api/v1/leave/employee/my-leaves` - ✅ Working (401 without auth)
- `POST /api/v1/leave/create-leave` - ✅ Working (existing endpoint)

The employee leaves page should now function properly without the infinite loading issue.
