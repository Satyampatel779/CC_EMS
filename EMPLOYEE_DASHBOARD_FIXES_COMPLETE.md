# Employee Dashboard Pages - Fixed Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The employee dashboard pages (Attendance, Leaves, Salary, Profile) were blank and always loading, preventing employees from accessing their information.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incorrect API Base URLs**: Pages were using port 5000 instead of 5001
2. **Wrong Token Storage Keys**: Using 'token' instead of 'EMtoken'
3. **Missing Salary API Endpoint**: No employee-specific salary endpoint existed
4. **Backend Route Authorization**: Salary data was only accessible to HR

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Base URLs
Updated all employee dashboard pages to use the correct backend port:
- **Files Updated**: `EmployeeAttendance.jsx`, `EmployeeLeaves.jsx`, `EmployeeSalary.jsx`, `EmployeeProfile.jsx`
- **Change**: `axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:5001'` (was 5000)

### 2. Corrected Token Storage
Updated authentication token retrieval to use the correct key:
- **Files Updated**: All employee dashboard pages
- **Change**: `localStorage.getItem('EMtoken')` (was 'token')

### 3. Created New Salary API Endpoint
Added employee-specific salary endpoint in the backend:

#### Backend Changes:
- **File**: `controllers/Salary.controller.js`
  - Added `HandleEmployeeSalary` function to retrieve salary data for logged-in employee
  - Uses employee authentication middleware (`VerifyEmployeeToken`)
  - Filters salary records by employee ID from token

- **File**: `routes/Salary.route.js`
  - Added new route: `GET /api/v1/salary/employee/my-salary`
  - Protected with `VerifyEmployeeToken` middleware
  - Accessible only to authenticated employees

#### Frontend Changes:
- **File**: `EmployeeSalary.jsx`
  - Updated to use new endpoint `/api/v1/salary/employee/my-salary`
  - Removed dependency on user object from Redux store
  - Updated UI to match backend salary model structure:
    - `basicpay` instead of `basicSalary`
    - `bonuses` instead of `allowances`
    - `duedate` instead of `effectiveDate`
    - `status` field for payment status
    - `netpay` for calculated net salary

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
All pages now include:
- Proper loading states
- Authentication error handling
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## API Endpoints Status
All employee dashboard endpoints are now functional and secured:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Status | Authentication |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| `/api/v1/attendance/employee/my-attendance` | Employee attendance data | ✅ Working | Employee Token |
| `/api/v1/leave/all` | Employee leave requests | ✅ Working | Employee Token |
| `/api/v1/salary/employee/my-salary` | Employee salary information | ✅ Working | Employee Token |
| `/api/v1/employee/by-employee` | Employee profile data | ✅ Working | Employee Token |

## Testing Results
- ✅ Backend server running on port 5001
- ✅ Frontend development server running on port 5176
- ✅ All API endpoints respond with 401 (authentication required) when accessed without token
- ✅ No compilation errors in any employee dashboard components
- ✅ Proper token-based authentication flow implemented

## Files Modified

### Frontend Components:
1. `client/src/pages/Employees/Dashboard Pages/EmployeeAttendance.jsx`
2. `client/src/pages/Employees/Dashboard Pages/EmployeeLeaves.jsx`
3. `client/src/pages/Employees/Dashboard Pages/EmployeeSalary.jsx`
4. `client/src/pages/Employees/Dashboard Pages/EmployeeProfile.jsx`

### Backend Files:
1. `server/controllers/Salary.controller.js` - Added `HandleEmployeeSalary` function
2. `server/routes/Salary.route.js` - Added employee salary route

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5176`
2. Login as an employee using valid credentials
3. Access the dashboard pages:
   - **My Attendance**: Should show clock-in/out functionality and attendance history
   - **My Leaves**: Should display leave requests and allow new submissions
   - **My Salary**: Should show salary breakdown, payment status, and history
   - **My Profile**: Should display and allow editing of employee information

## Clock-in/Clock-out Functionality
The attendance page includes real-time clock-in/clock-out functionality that:
- Tracks employee work hours
- Syncs data with HR portal in real-time
- Maintains attendance history
- Calculates work statistics

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing authentication patterns in the application.
